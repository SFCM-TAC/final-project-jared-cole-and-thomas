Our final project is a color matching version of Katamari. In this game you use the arrow keys to control a small circular character. A target color will appear on the bottom right side of the screen. Your goal is to collect the right blobs of color to turn your circle into the same color as the answer. When you think you have the right answer, head to the lake in the circle. If you are right, the field will reset and you will have a new color option. If you are wrong, the field will reset and the option will remain the same.
